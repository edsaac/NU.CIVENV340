# üåä CIV-ENV 340: Hydraulics and Hydrology üåä

This material was first made to support the course *CIV-ENV 340: Hydraulics and Hydrology* that I taught during the Spring quarter of 2023 at Northwestern University. 

It is divided in the ten weeks of the quarter, covering concepts in hydraulics of presurized pipe systems, open channel flow, and basic hydrology. This class included short computational projects, in which we...

- ... built our own EPANET¬Æ using scipy
- ... made a gradually-variable flow calculator
- ... delineated a real watershed programatically
- ... queried and analyzed stream gauge data from USGS

## How to use this material?

These contents are bundled into an interactive book that can be run locally or online. The online version is hosted in Streamlit Commnunity Cloud at [hydraulics.streamlit.app](https://hydraulics.streamlit.app/).

The pages marked with a üêç indicate the projects involving using Python. The rest correspond to supplemental material for the lectures, like diagrams and interactive plots.

To run the book locally, you will need to install Python and the packages listed in `requirements.txt`. Then, run the following command:

```bash
